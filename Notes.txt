# Per Instructions

* (6c) Need to add rounding/precision so that non-terminating decimals don't run too far
+ Look up why JS truncates the decimals without explicit code

# Misc
- Add 'history' into display window (eg) above where answer is displayed. This will show the expression that was just evaluated, eg:
History (above): 9 + 5 =
Display window: 14

- Update to include use of [objects] somehow

# Style
- Make answer in window bold
= Make it a slightly different color too
= Will need to remove bold/color upon user appending operator to [answer]
