# Per Instructions
+ (6b) Need to account for functionality in instruction 6b. For an expression with multiple operators, after user enters first (term1 operator term2) sequence, the calculator should show the result of that expression immediately.
+ (6d) Add checks for if equal button pressed too early
+ (6f) Account for division by zero
+ (7) Add functionality for decimal point
+ (9) Add backspace button


* (6c) Need to add rounding/precision so that non-terminating decimals don't run too far
+ Look up why JS truncates the decimals without explicit code
- (10) Add keyboard support

# Misc
+ If [windowShowingAnswer is true], and the user clicks an operator (eg, "+"), update global vars as needed so the user can evaluate the resulting expression with "="
+ Restrict entry of operators in certain conditions
+ Update to remove 'current number sequence' variable; replace logic with a boolean for 'expression has operator'

- Add 'history' into display window (eg) above where answer is displayed. This will show the expression that was just evaluated, eg:
History (above): 9 + 5 =
Display window: 14

- Update to include use of [objects] somehow

# Style
+ Increase size of all elements by 1.5
- Animate buttons on click event; ie, make it look like they're clicked
- Make answer in window bold
= Make it a slightly different color too
